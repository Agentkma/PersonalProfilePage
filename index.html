        <h2> PAST</h2>
            <h3>Home Town </h3>
            <p>I'm from Calabash, North Carolina, a coastal town 5 minutes from the North Carolina / South Carolina state line.</p>
            <p>I grew up playing sports and started surfing at age 10.  I lived there until I went to Univeristy at age 18.</p>

            <h3>Education </h3>
            <p>I started University at Applachian State in the western mountains of North Carolina and finished at University of North Carolina at Wilmington with a degree in Business Administration.</p>
            <p>I then attended two Real Estate Schools in Wilmington and acquired my North Carolina Real Estate Sales and Brokers License.</p>

            <h3>Work </h3>
            <p> I worked with Century 21 Real Estate in Wilmington for a short time after this before accepting a position in Construction Management in Calabash, North Carolina.</p>
            <p>I worked there until mid 2017 leaving the company as the General Manager and qualifying General Contractor Licensee. I decided to leave the construction industry and enter the Tech world and received a Techdegree from Team Treehouse mid 2017 in Front End Web Development.</p>

                <p>I married my best friend Karen Candia on May 31, 2016 in Ravello, Italy.</p>
                <p>My parents, a couple aunts, uncles and cousins from my father's side still live in the Calabash area.</p>
                <p>My only sibling, brother Mark, lives in Los Angeles, California.</p>

                <h3>Relocation</h3>
                <p> My wife and I moved to Broomfield, Colorado the first week of June 2017.</p>
                <p> We vacationed a few times in the Front Range and really loved it. We also chose this location as it is about half hour to Denver and Boulder/Mountains making it a good locale while I'm attending Galvanize's Full Stack Web Dev Immersive the second half of 2017. </p>
